## Milestone 2 🚀 

## 📌 Overview  
Welcome to **Milestone 2** of our e-commerce application development! In this phase, we focus on setting up the project structure, frontend, backend, and styling, along with developing the **Login Page**.  

## 🛠️ Key Features  
### 📁 Project Folder Structure  
- Organize files into **frontend** and **backend** directories for better maintainability.  

### ⚛️ React Frontend Setup  
- Initialize a **React.js** application using Vite for a fast development experience.  

### 🟢 Node.js Backend Setup  
- Set up a basic **Node.js** server to prepare for API integration in the next milestones.  

### 🎨 Tailwind CSS Configuration  
- Integrate and configure **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, utility-based styling.  

### 🔐 Login Page Development  
- Build a **Login Page** with a user-friendly design and authentication functionality.

## Milestone 3 🛠️  

## 📌 Overview  
Welcome to **Milestone 3** of our e-commerce application development! This phase focuses on setting up the backend structure, server configuration, database integration, and error handling.  

## 🛠️ Key Features  

### 📁 Backend Folder Structure  
- Organize backend files into a structured hierarchy, including **routes, controllers, models, and middleware**.  
- Introduce **utils** and **middlewares** for better code organization and maintainability.  

### 🖥️ Server Setup  
- Use **Node.js** and **Express** to create a backend server.  
- Configure the server to listen on a designated port.  

### 🗄️ Database Connection  
- Integrate **MongoDB** for efficient data storage.  
- Establish and confirm a stable connection between the server and MongoDB.  

### ⚠️ Error Handling  
- Implement clear error messages for improved debugging and user feedback.

## Milestone 4 📦  

## 📌 Overview  
Welcome to **Milestone 4** of our e-commerce application development! In this phase, we focus on defining the **User Model**, creating the **User Controller**, and setting up **Multer** for file uploads.  

## 🛠️ Key Features  

### 🗺️ What’s a Model?  
- A **model** acts as a detailed map or plan for structuring data.  
- The **User Model** defines how user data (e.g., name, email, password) is stored in the database.  
- In **MongoDB**, we use **Schemas** to define the structure of a model.  

### 🎯 What’s a Controller?  
- A **controller** manages how the server responds to different requests.  
- For example, the **User Controller** handles user signup by managing data flow between the frontend and database.  
- Think of it as a "manager" ensuring smooth communication between different parts of the app.  

### 📂 File Uploads with Multer  
- Users may need to upload files like profile pictures.  
- **Multer** is a Node.js middleware that helps manage file uploads efficiently.  
- It allows storing user images on the server, acting like a virtual file cabinet.  

## 📝 Steps for Milestone 4  
This milestone will be covered in a **mentor-led lesson**, where your mentor will guide you through:  
1. **Explaining and creating the User Model**  
2. **Creating the User Controller**  
3. **Setting up Multer for file uploads**

## **Milestone 5 📝**  

## 📌 **Overview**  
Welcome to **Milestone 5** of our e-commerce application development! In this phase, we will focus on creating the **Sign-Up Page** and implementing **form validation** to ensure a smooth user experience.  

## 🛠️ **Key Features**  

### 📝 **What’s a Sign-Up Page?**  
- The **Sign-Up Page** allows users to enter their details to create an account.  
- It typically includes fields like:  
  - **Name**  
  - **Email**  
  - **Password**  
- Once the user fills out the form, the data is sent to the server for processing.  
- We’ll design a **clean and user-friendly** sign-up form.  

### ✅ **What is Form Validation?**  
- **Form Validation** ensures that the information users enter is in the correct format.  
- Key validation checks include:  
  - **Email format validation** (ensuring a valid email structure).  
  - **Password validation** (checking length and security criteria).  
- Validation helps prevent errors and ensures that the backend receives clean data.  

## 📝 **Steps for Milestone 5**  
In this milestone, you will work on the **frontend**, while your mentor will guide you through:  
1. **Building the Sign-Up Page using HTML and CSS**.  
2. **Adding form validation to ensure users input valid data**.
